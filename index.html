        <p> Hi, my name is Devin Faber-Milks, I am 21 years old, and I currently live in a small town called Rigby which is located in
          the south-eastern section of the state of Idaho. </p>
        <p> I am originally from Colorado Springs, Colorado although I have lived in Idaho for two years now after moving from Colorado back in August of 2020.</p>
        <p> While I like living in Idaho, Colorado is home to me as I have lived there most of my life, and the change of scenery when I moved to Idaho was drastically different
          to the landscape Colorado had, especially with the mountains being so close to the city of Colorado Springs. The area where I live in Idaho is very flat and is
          primarily used for farming which really contrasts with the landscape of Colorado Springs. </p>

      <h3> About Me </h3>
      <div class = "infoBlock">
        <p> I chose the path of software engineering for a multitude of reasons, but the primary reason being I was not sure what I wanted to go to college for,
          I completed two years of college to get most of the prerequisite courses out of the way but I was unsure of what I wanted to pursue for a degree major.
          A friend of mine suggested I give software engineering a try, as I have never done anything related to it, 
          and I joined the Thinkful program as it was the same program my friend had gone through. </p>
        <p> Outside of software enginnering I have many interests and hobbies some of which include military aviation, cars and motorcycles, car racing,
          as well as gaming with my friends and spending time with my family. </p>
