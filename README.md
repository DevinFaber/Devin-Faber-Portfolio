# Devin Faber Portfolio Page

## Project Purpose

This project is meant to serve as a one page website that I intend to use as a portfolio which contains some information about myself as well as a way to test some of my skills using HTML and CSS code. 

I can always come back later on and add to this as I learn more about software development and I can update and add more to it if I want this to serve a larger purporse than just a simple business card or portfolio web page.
